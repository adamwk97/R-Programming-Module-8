<p>First we import the dataset and then create a column for average grades by gender and append it to a new dataframe.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">df &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">read.csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;C:/Users/adamw/Downloads/Assignment 6 Dataset-1.txt&quot;</span>)

StudentAverage =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">ddply</span>(df,<span class="st">&quot;Sex&quot;</span>,transform,<span class="dt">Grade.Average=</span><span class="kw">mean</span>(Grade))</code></pre>
<p>Now we can subset the dataframe and only keep rows that have names which contain an &quot;i&quot; and then export the file to a csv.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">i_students =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">subset</span>(df, <span class="kw">grepl</span>(<span class="st">&quot;i&quot;</span>, df$Name, <span class="dt">ignore.case=</span>T))
<span class="kw">write.csv</span>(i_students, <span class="st">&quot;i_Students_Gendered_Mean&quot;</span>)</code></pre>
<p>While I am familiar with the first half of the assignment concerning subsetting and appending new columns of data, I had not really ever exported a dataset so it was interesting and nice to see how simple it is. I was able to load the file into Excel with no problem.</p>
